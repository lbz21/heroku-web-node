            <h1>Time management at work</h1>
            <p class="lead">Managing your time well at university or work always comes out to be a huge problem for many people, including myself. But why is that? Could it be the fact that some people are just really lazy, unproductive, or just simply they have too
                much work to carry on their shoulders and heads. Recently, I have realised how important time-management is, especially in the hard "Covid 19." times, when we all have to go through, and at the same time adapt to many new changes in our work life.
            </p><br>
            <p class="mb-0">In order to meet all of your academic deadlines and still have time to enjoy life, it is vital to manage your time at university. Having a structured approach to managing your time is key to staying in control of your work. Watch this introductory
                video for general advice from staff and students about managing your time at university. As I person who has recently started valuing the importance of time-management, I can take my time to list few of the things that will change if you
                are to manage your time well at work, university or whatever you are doing for living</p><br>

            <p class="lead"> How does time-management change your life at work or university?</p>
            <p>
                <p>There are lots of different ways to tackle the issue of time management — you can download apps, adjust your sleep time, create lists, etc. But if you don’t fully understand why it’s important for you to better manage your time, those
                    apps and lists aren’t going to help you. If you don’t have the motivation to use them, you won’t.</p>
            </p><br>
            <p>First things first. You first have to imagine a bright new future for yourself, or in a simple words, you need to know how time-management will help change your life, and have different attitude to what you do. In the next section below, I
                have included eight or more reasons to manage your time well. Have a small read, and maybe consider them for the future. Change will come.</p>


            <h3><u>Why is time-management important?</u></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Let’s face it, if you have good time management skills, the chances are that you’re highly self-disciplined. You’re the kind of person who stops procrastination dead in its tracks and drives forward to achieve your goals. This self-discipline
                    improves other areas of your life too, from your career to your relationships. In other words, the better you get at time management, the better your self-discipline will be. This will make you more successful at meeting goals in all
                    areas of your life.</li>
                <li> One of the hidden dangers of poor time management is that it kills your chances of broadening your horizons and trying out new things. If you go through life rushing from one task to the next, you never have the chance to explore different
                    opportunities. With more free time, you may be able to volunteer at a local charity or help someone in need. It’s hard to put a dollar value on these types of tasks but they are innately fulfilling and enriching.</li>
                <li> Being in control of your time is great for productivity. You’ll find that you can get far more done in less time when you aren’t constantly rushed off your feet. You’ll have enhanced focus and efficiency because you won’t lose momentum
                    by having to deal with multiple time-sensitive tasks in a rushed manner. You’ll breeze through your work day and time will fly by.</li>
                <li>The most effective use of time is when we can focus on the projects, opportunities and people that matter. Rather than trying to do everything and constantly play catch up, effective time management will help you focus your time on only
                    a small number of productive activities.</li>
                <li>Managing your time using effective time management techniques will help you free up more of your time to do more of the things that matter most to you. This could be more time away from work to spend with family and friends or to pursue
                    a new hobby or to invest time in something important to you.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>Time management isn’t a pipe dream. It is possible to get done what you’re supposed to and to still have a social life, time for your family and the ability to go to the gym. In fact, if you’re not doing these things, it’s going to take a
                toll on you in the long run. You’ll run yourself down faster, be less healthy and deliver sub-par work.+</p>
