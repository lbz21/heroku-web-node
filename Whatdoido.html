            <p style="text-align:center"><i>All time-management begins with planning - Tom Greening</p></i>
                <p class="lead">My name is Lyuboslav Brankov, and I'm currently second year BS Hons Computing student at Southampton Solent University. I also work as a sales assistant part-time in Portsmouth. As I student, and an employee, I know how important it is
                    to be able to manage your time well, especially in those tough times that we have all been through and experienced. Lets be honest, 2020 has been a hard year for all of us. An year of uncertanties, and changes. Without a doubt, this
                    horrible year has had a lot negative impacts in our workplace, school, and university. If anyone was to say to you that nothing changed for him, you would probably assume that he was telling a big lie. I personally faced a lot of uncertanties
                    at university and work, and thanks them, I have realised that if I wanted to increase my chance in succeding in life, I had to improve my attitude towards work, and perhaps learning. Wihtout a doubt, the challanges I faced this year
                    made me realise how important time-management is at work and university, and this has definatelly changed my life. I also thought that creating a website on tackling the problem with time-management would help a lot of people at work
                    improve performance, especially in those hard times.

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align:center">Feel free to explore my website to find out more about time management and how it can improve the working environment that we are in. I have included an "Advice" page explaining further on why the "time-management" is good. I have
                        even included some advice from professionals.</p><br>

                        <p class="lead" style="text-align:center">I know better than myself that the communication with my customers is a key, and I always value their feedback and opinions. Therefore, I have created a feedback page, where you can also send us you details so we can
                        in touch with you on our events.</p><br>
