                <p class="lead">Time management is the process of planning and controlling how much time to spend on specific activities. Good time management enables an individual to complete more in a shorter period of time, lowers stress, and leads to career success.
                    <p class="lead" style="text-align:center">The ability to manage your time effectively is important. Good time management leads to improved efficiency and productivity, less stress, and more success in life. Here are some benefits of managing time effectively:</p><br>

                    <p style="text-align:center">
                        When it comes to time management, the first step you need to take is finding out where your time actually goes. You may believe that you only send 30 minutes on emails, but in reality that task is eating-up an hour of your day.

                    </p>



                    <p style="text-align:center">
                        I've found that setting a time limit to each task prevents me from getting distracted or procrastinating. For example, if I want to write an article for my blog, I give myself two hours. So if I made a start 10am, I try to get it written by 10am. In a way,
                        it becomes just like a fun game. Since I put those annoying buffers between tasks and daily activities, if I don’t complete the task on time, I can still work on it without eating into the time reserved for something else.

                        When it comes to time management, the first step you need to take is finding out where your time actually goes, and what do you do to waste your time. You may believe that you only send 30 minutes on emails, but in reality that task is eating-up more than two hours of your day.

                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align:center">
                        From my experience, I've realised that one of the worst things that you can do is wake-up without a previously planning your day. Instead of focusing on what needs to be done, you wander aimlessly and don't contribute to your tasks.

                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align:center">
                        If you’re reading this article then it’s obviously because you want to discover some useful time management - and I’m more than happy to help you put. But, if you’re struggling with time management, the solution may be as simple as changing your schedule
                        around. For example, instead of sleeping-in until 10, wake up two hours early. Personally, I find 8am to be the most productive time of the day since it gives me time to fit in a quick jog, plan-out my day, check my emails, and
                        even work on my assesments without getting easily distracted. Also, consider waking-up earlier on the weekends and maybe cut-down on the amount of TV that you watch.

                        Allocating a finite time period to tasks help you complete them on time. It also helps you to manage your workload in the most effective way. When you have time-boxed tasks, your brain gets rewired to follow the structure and accomplish those activities
                        within the desired time-frame. Thus, you can easily deliver work on time if you have managed your time well.

                        It is no secret that effective time management skills make you more productive and efficient as a working professional. These skills are helpful in helping you finish tasks as early as possible without compromising on the quality of work. Your overall
                        productivity often goes for a toss when you’re working on unimportant tasks but effective time management skills let you tick off tasks that are both important and urgent on time.

                        One of the worst things that you can do is wake-up without a plan for the day. Instead of focusing on what needs to be done, you wander aimlessly and take care of more trivial matters.

                        Effective Time Management helps an employee to reach the pinnacle of success quickly and stay firm at the top for a longer duration. An employee who works just for the sake of working fails to create an impression and is never taken seriously at work.
                        Effective time management plays an important role in increasing your productivity for the day. You will see. When people manage their time well, the Output increases substantially .
